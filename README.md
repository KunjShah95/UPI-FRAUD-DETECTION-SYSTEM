## Introduction üìñ

Welcome to the UPI Fraud Detection System! This repository is dedicated to detecting fraudulent activities in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. The system leverages machine learning techniques to identify suspicious transactions in real-time.

**New Fixed Notebook**: `Data_Analysis_for_UPI_Payment_Systems_Fixed.ipynb` - Contains all resolved issues and improved implementation.

Features ‚ú®

Real-time Fraud Detection: Monitors transactions in real-time and flags suspicious activities. This ensures immediate action can be taken to prevent fraudulent transactions.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes advanced ML algorithms to predict fraudulent behavior. These models are trained on historical transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraud.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for managing and reviewing flagged transactions. This interface allows users to quickly assess and act on potential fraud cases.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle large volumes of transactions efficiently. The system can scale horizontally to manage increased transaction loads without performance degradation.

## üîß Issues Resolved

### Critical Fixes ‚úÖ

1. **SettingWithCopyWarning Resolution**
   - **Issue**: Pandas warning when modifying dataframe slices
   - **Fix**: Used `.copy()` method for dataframe operations
   - **Impact**: Eliminated warnings and potential data corruption

2. **IndentationError Correction**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent indentation causing syntax errors
   - **Fix**: Standardized 4-space indentation throughout
   - **Impact**: Code now runs without syntax errors

3. **Package Version Conflicts**
   - **Issue**: Incompatible scikit-learn, XGBoost, and imbalanced-learn versions
   - **Fix**: Updated `requirements.txt` with compatible versions
